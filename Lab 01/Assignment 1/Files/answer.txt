The Average attendance percentage of all the students is calculated as follows.

         Average attendance percentage of all the students = (Total Number of lectures attended by all students*100)/(45*61)

So if the average attendance percentage of all the students is 50%,then the Total Number of lectures attended by all students will be,

         Total Number of lectures attended by all students = (Average attendance percentage of all the students*45*61)/100
                                                           = (50*45*61)/100
                                                           = 1372.5

Since the number of lectures attended by a student is a whole number which means int,we cannot get a float value for Total Number of lectures attended by all students as calculated above.
Therefore we cannot get 50% as the average attendance percentage of all the students.
